<p>These smoked spare ribs are our family's favorite. Slightly sweet and spicy, the light, cider-based mop sauce doesn't overpower the delicious meat that falls off the bone.</p>

<h2>How to Make Smoked Pork Spare Ribs</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the ribs: Mix brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, salt, cumin, cinnamon, jalapeño seasoning, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Place spareribs into a glass baking dish and rub generously with seasoning mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, prepare an outdoor charcoal grill for indirect heat, or preheat a smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
    <li>While the grill is preheating, make the mop sauce: Stir cider, vinegar, jalapeño pepper, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, onion powder, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>When the coals are gray and ashed over, place two handfuls of soaked wood chips directly on them. Place ribs onto the grill grate, bone-side down. Cover and cook for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Every hour, baste ribs with mop sauce and throw handfuls of soaked wood chips onto the coals. Add more coals as needed to ensure the cooking temperature doesn't drop below 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Discard any leftover mop sauce.</li>
